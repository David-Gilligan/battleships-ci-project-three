As advised when submitting my project 2, I currently do not have the time available to complete all my lessons due to work constraints in my new job (I was required to do quite a lot of overtime in the build up to Christmas and worked most days during the holidays too). 

Having spoke to Student Care they advised I would be able to take a leave of absence after this projects submission date however I would then not have access to the course material to catch up, so I have made a breif attempt at creating this battleships game however it could not be completed so again I know this is a fail and now as my work will be dying down I will organise with them the resubmission dates for my failed projects, begin to catch up on the lessons and have them completed ASAP.

Thanks for your understanding.
